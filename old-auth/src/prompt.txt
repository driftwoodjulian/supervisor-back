I need a vite proyect, that doesnt use typescript or next.js, just react, no tailwindo just plain css or bootstrap, also a .evn file where to put all api endpointsfreatures: 1: login when you call the app it should first check if you have a jwt stored for the app, if so it will send it to 10.10.1.180:5000/auth/check with it as a bearer in a GET request, the app will return a json like this{ "role": "user", "status": "valid", "username": "testuser"}with a 200 status if the endpoint returns a 401, 404, 500delete the jwt and just take them to the login cardif you dont have a jwt stored from the beggining show them the login card as wellin the login card page there should be a title above the card that says "Palatron 5000" there must be and imput for username and password the inputs should be sent to an enpoint 10.10.1.180:5000/auth/login

this will return a json {"jwt": token} with a 500 code, if its a 401 ask to check credentials with a warning in the card

2: Main

once the user has a valid jwt he will be able to acces the main menu

the main menu should consist of a welcome sign with the users name

the nave with have the option for three tools, IP , BACKUPS and CARGA

when you press on the Carga tool on the nav:

it will give you an input for a SERVER once the input is given and a botton that says query is clicked it must send a json with the jwt as bearer and the server and username similar to this: {"user":"JulianZeb","srv":"cvar4"}

this is to be sent to 10.10.1.180:5000/api/carga

the api will return a json with iether a 200, 500 or 400:

{        "data": " 14:06:01 up 5 days,  3:59,  0 users,  load average: 5.27, 4.90, 4.93"},200

{ "error": "not a user"},400

{"error": "not a server"},400

{ "error": "error ejecutando query"},400

if it returns and error show the error on the page that in a way that the user can see it even if he sends another requests, all responses are logged on top of the old one, the top being the most recent ones

as for the IP tool

similar to carga it will have an input for the server but also asking for and ip

to 10.10.1.180:5000/api/ipcheck it has to send the jwt as a bearer and a body like:

{
    "srv": "example",
    "ip": "123.123.123.123"
    "username": "user123"
}


the response can have a 500 or 200 or 400 status


if the response is 500 or 400 it will have an error file that you should log in the web for the user like in CARGA

the newest response on top, the old ones on the bottom

if the response is a 200 the response should be logger in the same fashion




As for the BACKUPS tool it will need an input for the server and the client name along with the jwt as a bearer

{
    "user":"JulianZeb",
    "srv":"cra4",
    "client":"vimaxcin"
}

the responses should be logged simillarly to the other 2 tools, with the newest on top and older on the bottom




Now as for styling the pages should make use of a dark blue, dark gray and navy blue tones in the pallette
